Daddy's with you in your prayers<br>No more crying, wipe them tears, daddy's here, no more nightmares<br>We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it<br>Lainie, uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it<br>We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls<br>When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls<br>Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusing you<br>Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news<br>I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow, it seems<br>The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me<br>All the things growin' up as daddy that he had to see<br>Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did<br>We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me<br>But things have got so bad between us<br>I don't see us ever being together ever again<br>Like we used to be when we was teenagers<br>But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason<br>I guess it was never meant to be<br>But it's just something we have no control over, and that's what destiny is<br>But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep<br>Maybe one day, we'll wake up, and this will all just be a dream<br>Now hush, little baby, don't you cry<br>Everything's gonna be alright<br>Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya<br>Daddy's here to hold ya through the night<br>I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why<br>We feel how we feel inside<br>It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby<br>But I promise mama's gon' be alright<br>Huh, it's funny<br>I remember back one year when daddy had no money<br>Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree<br>And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em<br>I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying<br>'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see, daddy had a job<br>But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom<br>And at the time, every house that we lived in<br>Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed<br>Or shot up on the block<br>And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar<br>Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college<br>Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it<br>And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart<br>And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart<br>Mom and dad was arguin' a lot<br>So mama moved back on to Chalmers in a flat one-bedroom apartment<br>And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara<br>And that's when daddy went to California with his CD<br>And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and mama out to see me<br>But daddy had to work, you and mama had to leave me<br>Then you started seeing daddy on the TV, and mama didn't like it<br>And you and Lainie were too young to understand it<br>Papa was a rolling stone, mama developed a habit<br>And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it<br>I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first-hand<br>'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud<br>Now I'm sittin' in this empty house<br>Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out<br>To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now<br>Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here<br>Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here<br>I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?<br>Shh, mama's only gone for the moment<br>Now hush, little baby, don't you cry<br>Everything's gonna be alright<br>Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya<br>Daddy's here to hold ya through the night<br>I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why<br>We feel how we feel inside<br>It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby<br>But I promise mama's gon' be alright<br>And if you ask me to, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird<br>I'ma give you the world<br>I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you<br>I'll do anything for you to see you smile<br>And if that mockingbird don't sing, and that ring don't shine<br>I'ma break that birdie's neck<br>I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya<br>And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad
