Let's go back to the summer night<br>When we met eyes, it's like a movie line<br>Kissin' underneath the city lights<br>But now you're laying in another guy's arms<br>'Cause I'm all gone<br><br>But when you look in his eyes<br>Do you think of mine?<br>And when you look at that smile<br>Do I cross your mind?<br>I know in your head<br>You see me instead<br>'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then<br>Baby don't lie<br>He's just a lookalike<br><br>Can't redo what's already done<br>Can't compete 'cause I've already won<br>Sayin' this time, "It's really love"<br>But honey, you're not fooling anyone<br>Don't you know we're done?<br><br>But when you look in his eyes<br>Do you think of mine?<br>And when you look at that smile<br>Do I cross your mind?<br>I know in your head<br>You see me instead<br>'Cause he looks a lot like I did back then<br>Baby don't lie<br>He's just a lookalike<br><br>And I'll admit that I sometimes, maybe, might<br>Think about you at night, well, almost every night<br>No matter how I try to hide<br>And erase you from my mind<br>I'm dying<br>To find a lookalike<br><br>'Cause when you look in his eyes<br>Hope you think of mine<br>And when you look at that smile<br>Hope I cross your mind<br>I hope in your head<br>You see me instead<br>'Cause you've been in mine every day since then<br>Maybe it's time to find a lookalike<br><br>No, I can't lie<br>I need a lookalike<br>
